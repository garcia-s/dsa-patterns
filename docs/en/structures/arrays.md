# Arrays.

Arrays are one of the simplest data structures. Now, here we are talking about "real arrays" which should not beconfused with __ArrayLists__. Arrays are a "list" of contiguous memory that contain __something__.

They can contain pretty much anything you can imagine, pointers/references, numbers, characters, etc. In fact what we know as a "tring" it's actually an array of characters.

"Real arrays" are also known a static arrays and they do not grow, they can't increase the amount of items you can add to them but this definition of "static array" vs "dynamic array" it's up for debate. Since it depends on who you ask and the language you are using.

For example, in C an array doesn't grow. To have some sort of dynamic array you'll need an abstraction like __ArrayList__ or __ArrayBuffer__. But the terminology in a language like Javascript, where arrays are dynamic and buffered.
