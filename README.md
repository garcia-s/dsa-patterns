# All datastructures, known algorithms and design patterns

A collection of all the datastructures, algoriths, techniques and design patters for research purposes.
There is also a collection of common leetcode and codewars solutions. Although it'll take a long time to complete them

This is an incomplete work, and it'll probably never be complete as it will take forever to learn and code everything there is to know. However, I'll keep updating this as I learn more, and you are free to contribute.

I've been teaching these concepts to a couple of newer programmers so I'll be updating this as we progress through, and I'll be creating articles about everything in here.

I also have a [spanish translation](./README-es.md) if you need it
