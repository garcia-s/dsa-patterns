# Data Structures

Data structures are just way to organize, store and proccess data. They represent different ways in which data can be presented and handled in code. I understand this is a generic and abstract explanation, but I promise it'll make sense as you learn them.

This are basically the building blocks of computer programming so, consider learning as many as you can and nee.



Here are some of the datastructures and their variations:

### Arrays

Simply put an array is list of __things__ in a continous memory. Where all of this __things__ (or the references/pointers to the thing) are adjacent to each other.

There are other abstrations that use provide extra functionality over arrays, so it (kinda) makes sense to groupthem together as variations.
