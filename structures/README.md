# Data Structures

Data structures are just way to organize, store and proccess data. They represent different ways in which data can be presented and handled in code. I understand this is a generic and abstract explanation, but I promise it'll make sense as you learn them.

Here are some of the datastructures and their variations:

### Arrays

- [Arrays](./docs/arrays.md)
- [ArrayLists](./docs/arraylists.md)
- [Matrix/Grid](./docs/matrix.md)
- [Ring Buffers](./docs/matrix.md)


### Linked lists

- [Linked Lists](./docs/linked-lists.md)
- [Doubly Linked Lists](./docs/arrays.md)
- [Queues](./docs/arrays.md)
- [Stacks](./docs/arrays.md)
- [CircularLinkedLists](./docs/arrays.md)


### Trees

- [Binary Trees](./docs/linked-lists.md)
- [Binary Search Tree](./docs/linked-lists.md)
- [AVL Tree](./docs/linked-lists.md)
- [Red Black Tree](./docs/linked-lists.md)
- [Ternary Search Tree](./docs/linked-lists.md)
- [Generic Tree](./docs/linked-lists.md)
- [B Tree](./docs/linked-lists.md)
- [B+ Tree](./docs/linked-lists.md)
- [Radix Tree](./docs/linked-lists.md)
- [Trie](./docs/linked-lists.md)
