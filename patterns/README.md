# Software Design patterns

Design patterns are common solutions to prevalent problems in software design. 
Patterns are (sort of) blueprints that you can modify and customize to your needs but
provide some solutions to design problems on code.

In here we'll provide the language agnostic patters, since there are some patterns that might not be possible in some languages. 

There are about as many different design patterns as we can think of. So I'll just provide common ones as I believe they are relevant. 

##  Creational Patters

Creational Patters are the easiest ones to understand, they manage the process of creating something. 

- [Factory Method](./docs/FACTORY.md)
- [Abstract Factory ](./docs/ABSTRACT-FACTORY.md)
- [Builder](./docs/BUILDER.md)
- [Prototype](./docs/PROTOTYPE.md)
- [SINGLETON (ANTI) PATTERN](./docs/SINGLETON.md)

## Behavioral

- [Chain of responsability](./docs/FACTORY.md)

## Structural
