# Concepts to learn:

## Two pointers:
    - Slow and fast
    - Front and back


## Heaps
    - Min-heap
    - Max-heap 

## Sliding window
    
## Fast and slow pointers
## Stacks

## Overlapping intervals
    ...

## Modified binary sort
    ...

## Bin-tree traversal (
    - pre-order
    - in-order 
    - post-order
    - level-order

## Graph Searchs (iterative and recursive)
    - Depth first (DFS)
    - Breadth first (BFS)

## Dynamic programming
